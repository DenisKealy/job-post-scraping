# job-post-scraping

This project uses BeautifulSoup to extract dynamically loaded data from a job listing website.

In a Jupyter notebook, we scrape the job listings for 'Data Analyst' from an Egyptian website called Wuzzuf then extract the information from the listings and store the results in a csv file.
